# Database Management System Project 
## Made by Anjaneya Sharma and Ameya Kumar
Our application is an online retail store that facilitates buying and selling across various product categories. Customers can explore the product catalog, add items to their cart, and enjoy discounts on the total and delivery fee based on their subscription during checkout. Multiple payment options are available for convenient transactions. Sellers have admin privileges to manage the catalog and stock. Delivery partners can view and update delivery status for the products assigned to them. User details are securely stored in a database accessible only by the admin, while individual stakeholders can access their own account information.

This Project was made using Java and Embedded SQL (integrated using JDBC).
The final code is present in  *Anjaneya's_Branch* .

The details of major files in the branch are given below:-
1) updated_schema : Contains the database schema
2) populate_latest.sql : Contains data populated in the database.
3) mm.java  : Main code running the program
